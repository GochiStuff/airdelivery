                What Is P2P File Sharing?
              </h2>
              <div className="space-y-4">
                <p>
                  Peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing is a decentralized method for transferring data directly between
                  devices without relying on an intermediary server. Instead of uploading your files to a central
                  cloud service, P2P leverages direct connections—often via WebRTC in modern browser-based tools—to
                  exchange data. This approach yields several advantages in speed, privacy, and simplicity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In P2P file sharing, each participating device (peer) can act both as a client and a server:
                  sending and receiving files directly. This differs from traditional cloud uploads, where you
                  upload to a centralized storage (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive) and then the recipient downloads from
                  that server. With P2P, there is no third-party storage: the data travels directly from sender to
                  recipient, which can reduce latency and improve transfer speeds on local or regional connections.
                </p>
                  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li>No central server storage: reduces hosting costs and privacy concerns.</li>
                    <li>Often faster for same-region transfers or LAN transfers, since data flows directly.</li>
                    <li>Enhanced privacy: files do not persist on third-party servers, minimizing data breaches or
                      unauthorized access risks.</li>
                    <li>Easy to implement in-browser with WebRTC for modern web apps (no installation required).</li>
                    <li>Scalable: each peer contributes upload bandwidth, reducing load on any single server.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li>Requires both peers online simultaneously: cannot “store” files for later download.</li>
                    <li>Reliant on network conditions and NAT/firewall traversal (though WebRTC’s ICE/STUN/TURN
                      handles many cases).</li>
                    <li>Browser-based P2P may have file size or memory constraints depending on client resources.</li>
                    <li>Occasional connection issues if network is restrictive—requires proper signaling and fallback
                      (e.g., TURN) for reliable connectivity.</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>
                  Unlike cloud uploads, P2P file sharing emphasizes immediacy and directness. There’s no need to wait
                  for files to upload to a server then download; instead, data is streamed directly, often with
                  progress indicators based on actual transfer speed. Modern P2P uses WebRTC’s DataChannel API for
                  secure, encrypted peer-to-peer data channels right in the browser.

                Is P2P File Sharing Safe and Private?
              </h2>
              <div className="space-y-4">
                <p>
                  Security and privacy are paramount concerns for file sharing. P2P transfers, especially via
                  WebRTC DataChannels, typically provide encryption and direct peer-to-peer connections without
                  storing files on central servers. Let’s unpack this:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Encryption:</strong> WebRTC DataChannels use DTLS and SRTP under the hood, providing
                  end-to-end encryption between peers. This ensures that file data is encrypted during transit and
                  cannot be easily intercepted by on-path attackers. Always verify that HTTPS is used for the
                  signaling server and that secure WebRTC connections are established.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>No Central Storage:</strong> Because files are exchanged directly between peers, there’s
                  no persistent copy stored on cloud servers. Once the transfer completes, no leftover shards or
                  pieces remain on third-party infrastructure (beyond optional ephemeral signaling tokens).
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Anonymity & Privacy:</strong> Users need not provide personal information or create
                  accounts. AirDelivery’s workflow avoids user login or identity tracking, reducing data footprints.
                  For added anonymity, signaling servers can be configured to minimize logs or rotate session tokens.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Network Security Considerations:</strong> WebRTC uses ICE (Interactive Connectivity
                  Establishment) with STUN/TURN servers to negotiate connections behind NATs and firewalls. While
                  direct connections are preferred (peer-to-peer), fallback via TURN may route data through a
                  relay server temporarily; ensure your TURN servers are secure and transient, and policies do not
                  persist file data.
                </p>
                  <strong>Best Practices:</strong>
                  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li>Always access AirDelivery over HTTPS to secure signaling and initial handshake.</li>
                    <li>Use trusted STUN/TURN servers or your own infrastructure to avoid untrusted relays.</li>
                    <li>Encourage users to verify fingerprint or connection details if additional security is
                      desired (advanced users).</li>
                    <li>Implement optional automatic wipe of transient data on signaling servers after session ends.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                <p>
                  Cross-platform sharing between Android and iPhone can be challenging due to differing OS
                  ecosystems. AirDelivery solves this by leveraging browser-based WebRTC P2P transfers:
                </p>
                  <strong>Step-by-Step:</strong>
                  <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li>
                      Open AirDelivery in the browser on both Android and iPhone (modern browsers like Chrome,
                      Safari, Edge). Ensure both devices are connected to the internet or same local network.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      On one device, select “Send File” (or equivalent UI). A unique transfer ID or QR code is
                      generated.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      On the other device, choose “Receive File” and either enter the transfer ID or scan the QR
                      code shown on the sender’s screen. Scanning can be done via the built-in camera UI or a
                      browser prompt.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      After establishing signaling, WebRTC DataChannel initializes. Confirm the connection
                      prompt if shown, then start the file transfer. Progress bars display real-time transfer
                      speed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Once complete, files are received directly. No installation or signup is needed; it’s pure
                      browser-to-browser P2P.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <strong>Tips:</strong>
                  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li>
                      On Safari (iPhone), ensure you allow WebRTC permissions when prompted. Recent iOS
                      versions support WebRTC in Safari.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If devices cannot connect over internet due to strict NAT/firewall, try connecting over
                      same Wi-Fi network; local P2P may succeed without needing TURN relay.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Use QR codes for quick pairing: AirDelivery displays a QR code; scanning saves manual entry.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      For very large files, ensure both devices remain active (disable auto-lock). Some browsers
                      pause tabs in background—keep screen awake or use a browser feature to prevent sleeping.
                    </li>

                  <strong>Local Network Transfers:</strong> If both devices are on the same Wi-Fi network, AirDelivery
                  can use a local signaling server (hosted on LAN) or mDNS-based discovery (if implemented) to
                  exchange signaling data directly. Once signaling is done, WebRTC DataChannel streams file data
                  peer-to-peer over the LAN, requiring no internet gateway.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Using Mobile Hotspot:</strong> One device creates a mobile hotspot; the other connects.
                  Both devices are on the same private network. Open AirDelivery on both; since they share network,
                  signaling and transfer occur over local network without external internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Bluetooth / Local Signaling Prototypes:</strong> Advanced setups can embed Bluetooth
                  signaling (Web Bluetooth or native companion apps) to exchange WebRTC offer/answer payloads,
                  then establish direct peer-to-peer data channels. This requires additional coding and permissions
                  but enables true offline P2P.
                </p>
                  <strong>Practical Tips:</strong>
                  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li>
                      For most users, mobile hotspot or shared Wi-Fi is simplest: open AirDelivery site on both
                      devices, use the generated code/QR to pair, and transfer locally.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Ensure devices remain awake (disable auto-sleep) until transfer completes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      If direct local signaling is unavailable, minimal internet connectivity can be used just
                      for signaling: the actual file data flows over LAN once peers connect.

                <p>
                  AirDelivery supports virtually any file type as long as the browser can handle it. Common file
                  categories include images (JPEG, PNG, GIF), videos (MP4, WebM), documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT),
                  archives (ZIP, TAR), executables (EXE, DMG) if browser permits, and more.
                </p>
                  <strong>Size Limits:</strong> The theoretical limit for P2P file sharing in-browser is bound by
                  available memory and browser capabilities. Many modern browsers can handle multi-gigabyte files,
                  but practical factors include:
                  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li>Available device memory: Very large files may require chunking to avoid memory spikes.</li>
                    <li>Browser tab stability: Keep the tab active; background tabs may be throttled or suspended.</li>
                    <li>Network conditions: Large transfers over unstable connections may drop; implement resume or
                      chunked retransmission if needed.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <strong>Recommended Practices:</strong>
                  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li>Implement chunked transfer logic: split large files into manageable pieces to avoid

                  Sometimes transfers fail or stall. This section helps identify common issues and remedies for
                  P2P file sharing via WebRTC.
                </p>
                  <strong>1. Network and NAT/Firewall Issues:</strong>
                  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li>
                      <em>Symmetric NATs or restrictive firewalls:</em> WebRTC uses STUN/TURN servers to traverse NAT.
                      If direct peer connection fails, ensure fallback TURN servers are configured and reachable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <em>Blocked ports or corporate network:</em> Some networks block UDP or specific ports. Offer
                      TURN over TCP or HTTPS fallback if possible.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <strong>2. Browser Compatibility:</strong>
                  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li>Ensure both sender and receiver use updated modern browsers with WebRTC support (Chrome,
                      Firefox, Edge, Safari on recent iOS/macOS).</li>
                    <li>Check for browser-specific prompts: Safari may require explicit permission for WebRTC
                      usage; accept any “Allow” dialogs.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <strong>3. Tab or Device Sleep:</strong>
                  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li>
                      Background tab throttling: Keep the tab active during transfer. Prompt users to disable
                      auto-lock or screen dimming on mobile.
                    </li>
                    <li>Device sleep: Advise disabling sleep or using “keep screen awake” features until transfer
                      completes.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <strong>4. File Size and Memory Limits:</strong>
                  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li>Transfers of multi-GB files may exceed memory: implement chunked streaming and free memory
                      between chunks.</li>
                    <li>Check for “out of memory” errors: advise users to close other tabs/apps if resources are
                      low.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <strong>5. Signaling or Session Expiry:</strong>
                  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li>Signaling server timeouts: Ensure signaling tokens remain valid long enough for handshake.
                    </li>
                    <li>Re-initiate pairing: Provide clear UI to restart transfer if initial handshake fails or
                      times out.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <strong>6. Browser Permissions and HTTPS:</strong>
                  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li>Always serve AirDelivery over HTTPS: browsers block WebRTC on insecure origins.</li>
                    <li>Check for permissions issues: accept prompts for camera/microphone only if using advanced
                      features; file transfer alone usually does not require camera/mic, but QR code scanning may.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <strong>7. Logging and Diagnostics:</strong>
                  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li>Implement client-side logging: show simple console logs or UI logs for debugging ICE
                      candidates, connection state changes, and errors.</li>
                    <li>Offer a “diagnose connection” mode: gather ICE candidate info, network type, and surface
                      common fixes for users or support staff.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <strong>8. Fallback Options:</strong>
                  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li>When direct P2P fails, consider temporarily routing via a secure relay server (TURN)
                      while ensuring privacy policies.</li>
                    <li>Notify users transparently: “Direct connection failed; using relay for transfer. Data is still
                      encrypted end-to-end.”</li>
                  </ul>

                Can I Use AirDelivery for Large Files? (Over 1GB)
              </h2>
              <div className="space-y-4">
                <p>
                  Yes: AirDelivery supports large file transfers, potentially exceeding 1GB, provided proper
                  chunking, memory management, and connection stability. Here’s how to optimize for huge files:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Chunked Streaming:</strong> Break files into sequential chunks (e.g., 64MB or smaller)
                  to avoid browser memory overload. Process each chunk: read from file API, send over WebRTC, free
                  memory, then proceed with next chunk.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Progress Indication:</strong> Display per-chunk progress and overall percentage. This
                  reassures users during long transfers and helps estimate remaining time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Resume & Retry:</strong> Implement logic to retry failed chunks automatically, or allow
                  user to resume from last successful chunk if connection drops. This is especially important for
                  multi-GB transfers over unstable networks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Prevent Sleep:</strong> Prompt users to keep device awake. Show alerts if tab/browser
                  goes backgrounded, and pause/resume logic accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Network Conditions:</strong> For very large files, consider splitting into smaller
                  transfers or advising users to use stable Wi-Fi rather than cellular if possible. Provide a
                  “recommended connection” note.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Testing:</strong> Test across different devices and browsers for memory consumption,
                  crash resilience, and UI responsiveness during long transfers. Optimize UI updates to avoid
                  freezing main thread (use Web Workers or incremental rendering if necessary).

                How Does WebRTC Work for File Transfers?
              </h2>
              <div className="space-y-4">
                <p>
                  WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is the technology enabling peer-to-peer connections in
                  browsers. While often used for audio/video calls, WebRTC also supports arbitrary data channels
                  for file transfers. Here’s a high-level technical overview:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Signaling:</strong> Before peers can connect, they exchange session descriptions (SDP)
                  and ICE candidate info. This typically happens via a signaling server over HTTPS/WebSocket.
                  Signaling is not specified by WebRTC—developers implement their own via WebSocket, Socket.io,
                  or similar.
                </p>
                  <strong>ICE, STUN, and TURN:</strong>
                  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li><em>ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment):</em> orchestrates connection attempts between peers using network interfaces.</li>
                    <li><em>STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT):</em> helps determine public IP/port for NAT traversal.</li>
                    <li><em>TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT):</em> provides relay servers when direct peer-to-peer connection is blocked by strict NAT or firewall.</li>
                  </ul>
                <p>
                  <strong>Establishing Peer Connection:</strong> After exchanging ICE candidates and SDP offers/answers,
                  peers attempt to establish a direct connection. If direct connection succeeds, data flows
                  peer-to-peer; otherwise, TURN relay may be used.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Data Channels:</strong> Once connection is established, a WebRTC DataChannel is opened.
                  This is a bidirectional, message-oriented channel that can carry binary data (chunks of files)
                  or text. DataChannels support reliable (ordered) or unreliable modes; file transfers typically use
                  reliable, ordered channels.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Chunked File Transfer:</strong> Files are read via the File API (e.g., `FileReader` or
                  Streams API), sliced into ArrayBuffer or Blob chunks, and sent sequentially over DataChannel.
                  On the receiving side, chunks are concatenated (or streamed to a Blob) to reconstruct the file.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Progress & Flow Control:</strong> Monitor DataChannel bufferedAmount and readyState to
                  avoid overwhelming the channel. Implement backpressure: pause sending when bufferedAmount is high
                  and resume when drained. Provide UI updates (progress bars, speed indicators).
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Error Handling & Retries:</strong> Listen for DataChannel errors or connection state
                  changes. If connection drops, attempt reconnection: renegotiate via signaling or fallback to
                  TURN if direct fails.
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Browser Side:</strong> Temporary buffers hold file chunks during transfer, but once
                  complete, those buffers can be explicitly released or garbage-collected. AirDelivery’s code
                  should ensure to free memory references and avoid unintended retention of file data in memory.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Signaling Servers:</strong> Signaling exchanges offer/answer and ICE candidates. Best
                  practice is to handle signaling transiently and purge logs immediately after handshake, or
                  design servers to be stateless regarding file data. No file data should traverse signaling
                  servers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>TURN Relays:</strong> In cases where direct connection fails, TURN relays may carry
                  encrypted file data. Ensure TURN servers do not persist logs of transferred data, and use
                  ephemeral credentials so sessions cannot be replayed later. Maintain transparent privacy policy
                  that no file content is stored.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Local Storage & Caches:</strong> AirDelivery should avoid writing file data to IndexedDB
                  or localStorage unless explicitly needed for resume. If resume/chunk caching is implemented,
                  provide clear UI and allow users to clear cached data after transfer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>User Device:</strong> After download, files are saved to user’s chosen location (Downloads
                  folder). That is expected and under user control. No hidden caches or temp files should remain
                  after transfer completes.
                </p>
                  <strong>Privacy Recommendations:</strong>
                  <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
                    <li>Document privacy practices: state that AirDelivery does not store files on servers long-term.
                    </li>
                    <li>Provide options to clear any residual data in browser memory after session ends.</li>
                    <li>Use short-lived signaling tokens and rotate ICE/TURN credentials to minimize traceability.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                Why Use Browser-Based P2P Over Traditional Apps?
              </h2>
              <div className="space-y-4">
                <p>
                  Browser-based P2P file sharing offers unique benefits versus installing native apps:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Instant Access:</strong> No downloads or installations. Users can open a URL and start
                  sharing files immediately. Ideal for quick exchanges or one-off transfers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Cross-Platform Compatibility:</strong> Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS,
                  ChromeOS, and more via browsers. No need separate binaries or app store submissions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Security & Updates:</strong> Always run latest version when loading the page. No stale
                  app versions cause vulnerabilities. HTTPS-delivered JavaScript ensures up-to-date code.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Reduced Friction:</strong> Users avoid sign-ups, installs, and permissions beyond
                  necessary WebRTC confirmations. This increases adoption and reduces drop-off.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Maintenance & Deployment:</strong> Developers update server-side logic or static assets
                  centrally; users automatically get updates next time they visit. Simplifies distribution and
                  versioning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Resource Efficiency:</strong> No background services or daemons running when not in use.
                  Browser tab is active only during transfer. Device storage is not used for app install; code
                  is cached per browser caching rules.
